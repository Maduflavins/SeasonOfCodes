b) Why is the nextInt method of class SecureRandom useful for simulating games of
chance?
c) Why is it often necessary to scale or shift the values produced by a SecureRandom object?
d) Why is computerized simulation of real-world situations a useful technique?

a.	This implies choosing a number non-deterministically from a set range of values, whereby each value in the range have an equal chance of being selected
b.	This is because we can pass the scaling factor into it, to determine the number of values to be selected.
c.	Scaling helps us set the first figure in the selection (assuming the first number is not supposed to be a zero)
